# Purple

Up until today, I had internalized the fact that red + blue = purple. Specifically, a dark purple:

I had learned this from elementary school art class, where we'd mix paints, crayons, markers, on and on, and mixing red and blue pigments results in purple.

But today I was reviewing the RGB colors that computers display, and in RGB, combining red and blue (each at 255, their max values) results in _magenta_:

## Why the difference? Pigments vs pixels

First we need to ask, how do we see color? The light coming from the paint or screen enters our eyes and hits photoreceptor cells in the retina, which are attuned to different wavelengths of light:
