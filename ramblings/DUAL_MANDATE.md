# DUAL MANDATE: All eyes on the Fed

So you go to the grocery store and think yourself, "wow I swear the price of eggs/coffee/chocolate keeps going up" or "wow I swear the net amount of actual consumable food within this package is shrinking and yet the price is the damn same." And you spend some money on food anyways because you literally need the calories to survive until tomorrow, and then you go home. If you're renting, you say "wow my landlord is raising rent by a bunch next year" and if you were considering a new home, you say "wow I sure don't wanna get a mortgage at a 7% APY rate, guess I'll keep renting haha." And then you open CNBC/Bloomberg (on YouTube cuz who still has cable?) and you go "wow the economy is still apparently strong and unemployment is still currently low and there's still lots of new jobs each month, except of course in the tech/IT sector haha get fucked." And then you check on your high-yield savings account you opened a few years ago and tell yourself, "hey at least I still get ~4.0% APY here from my bank/fintech-advertising-cash-accounts-like-a-bank-but-it's-not-actually-it's-just-partnering-with-a-bank-using-cash-sweeps (WealthFront, SoFi) and it's decent money I get for just sitting here hooray."

Before you go to sleep you might wonder what the heck is driving these grocery prices and all these different rates.

A lot of people in the financial industry sure do. They'll trace the lines of how everyone's money flows to and fro: "Look, that same bank you get your high yield savings (or .01% APY if you're unlucky)? They hold part of your deposits in some electronic vault -- at least that's what the public might think. You trust the bank with your deposits, and in order to keep running, the bank has to assume that not all of its customers will suddenly want to withdraw 100% of the deposits it has. This disaster is called a bank run, like what happened to Silicon Valley Bank."

"Anyway, the bank takes this cash and tries to make extra revenue/profit from it, through investing in a way that would get them a higher return to the interest rate they pay you the customer. They might lend that money to a credit card holder, a mortgage holder, or to other financial institutions."

"How do those lending rates get set? You can imagine game theory where every actor is looking out for themselves and maximizing profits. In a totally free market without any oversight, you can imagine price wars or gouging or generally chaos in finding equilibrium rates, but then who would trust banks with their money? They'd keep it under their mattress or buy gold or a different currency. That's where the government comes in: namely the **Federal Reserve** and its glorious chairman **Jerome Powell**."

Suddenly "Hallelujah" starts playing in the background as they pray for their bank accounts.

"The bank can have deposit accounts with the Fed and the Fed will pay these accounts a set interest rate called the **interest rate on reserve balances (IORB)**. This effectively acts as a floor for the rate that the bank re-lends its money for to other financial institutions. This re-lend-to-others rate is called the **federal funds rate**, and confusingly this is shown as a .25% range since the hope is that there's enough demand for the Fed deposits that other lenders are willing to pay a little extra (I think, at least)."

"This federal funds rate now acts as a minimum rate for which banks are willing to re-re-lend to customers and businesses, essentially driving the whole economy through this monetary policy (contrast with fiscal policy which is spending driven through government spending programs like giving Social Security)."

The worshipper continues about this mostly-once-per-month JPow press conference that they dedicate almost their whole careers to. They dissect his every word, publish a pdf with red strikethrough of the diff changes between last month's conference, and do all sorts of mental gymnastics to forecast America's economic future from these words. 

Powell gets up on the podium in his blue suit and red tie, and always starts with [January 2025 transcript here]([(https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20250129.pdf)):

"Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our **dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices** for the benefit of the American people." (emphasis mine, but it'd be hilarious to me if he were to jump onto the podium and shout "DUAL MANDATE!!!" like a wrestler)

He'll talk a bit about recent labor (job) market conditions, inflation data, and then the key piece: what he and his colleagues at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have decided the target federal funds rate will be (he doesn't explicitly mention the IORB as the lever mechanism which they control to achieve that rate). (All this is released before he actually says this in a pdf for the market to dissect beforehand, but that that takes out the drama out of it.)
