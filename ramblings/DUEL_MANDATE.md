# DUEL MANDATE: All eyes on the Fed

So you go to the grocery store and think yourself, "wow I swear the price of eggs/coffee/chocolate keeps going up" or "wow I swear the net amount of actual consumable food within this package is shrinking and yet the price is the damn same." And you spend some money on food anyways because you literally need the calories to survive until tomorrow, and then you go home. If you're renting, you say "wow my landlord is raising rent by a bunch next year" and if you were considering a new home, you say "wow I sure don't wanna get a mortgage at a 7% APY rate, guess I'll keep renting haha." And then you open CNBC/Bloomberg (on YouTube cuz who still has cable?) and you go "wow the economy is still apparently strong and unemployment is still currently low and there's still lots of new jobs each month, except of course in the tech/IT sector haha get fucked." And then you check on your high-yield savings account you opened a few years ago and tell yourself, "hey at least I still get ~4.0% APY here from my bank/fintech-advertising-cash-accounts-like-a-bank-but-it's-not-actually-it's-just-partnering-with-a-bank-using-cash-sweeps (WealthFront, SoFi) and it's decent money I get for just sitting here hooray."

Before you go to sleep you might wonder what the heck is driving these grocery prices and all these different rates.

A lot of people in the financial industry sure do. They'll trace the lines of how everyone's money flows to and fro: "Look, that same bank you get your high yield savings (or .01% APY if you're unlucky)? They hold part of your deposits in some electronic vault -- at least that's what the public might think. You trust the bank with your deposits, and in order to keep running, the bank has to assume that not all of its customers will suddenly want to withdraw 100% of the deposits it has. This disaster is called a bank run, like what happened to Silicon Valley Bank."

"Anyway, the bank takes this cash and tries to make extra revenue/profit from it, through investing in a way that would get them a higher return to the interest rate they pay you the customer. They might lend that money to a credit card holder, a mortgage holder, or to other financial institutions."

"How do those lending rates get set? You can imagine game theory where every actor is looking out for themselves and maximizing profits. In a totally free market without any oversight, you can imagine price wars or gouging or generally chaos in finding equilibrium rates, but then who would trust banks with their money? They'd keep it under their mattress or buy gold or a different currency. That's where the government comes in: namely the ***Federal Reserve*** and its glorious chairman ***Jerome Powell***."

Suddenly "Hallelujah" starts playing in the background as they pray for their bank accounts.

"The bank can have deposit accounts with the Fed and the Fed will pay these accounts a set rate called the ***interest rate on reserve balances (IORB)***. This effectively acts as a floor for the rate that the bank re-lends its money for to other financial institutions. This re-lend-to-others rate is called the ***federal funds rate***, and confusingly this is shown as a .25% range since the hope is that there's enough demand for the Fed deposits that other lenders are willing to pay a little extra (I think, at least)."

"This federal funds rate now acts as a minimum rate for which banks are willing to re-re-lend to customers and businesses, essentially driving the whole economy through this monetary policy (contrast with fiscal policy which is spending driven through government spending programs like giving Social Security)."

The worshipper continues about this mostly-once-per-month JPow press conference that they dedicate almost their whole careers to. They dissect his every word, publish a pdf with red strikethrough of the diff changes between last month's conference, and do all sorts of mental gymnastics to forecast America's economic future from these words. 

Powell gets up on the podium in his blue suit and red tie, and always starts with: [example January 2025 transcript here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20250129.pdf)

"Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our ***dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices*** for the benefit of the American people." (emphasis mine, but it'd be hilarious to me if he were to jump onto the podium and shout "DUAL MANDATE!!!" like a wrestler)

He'll talk a bit about recent labor (job) market conditions, inflation data, and then the key piece: what he and his colleagues at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have decided the target federal funds rate will be (he doesn't explicitly mention the IORB as the lever mechanism which they control to achieve that rate). (All this is released before he actually says this in a pdf for the market to dissect beforehand, but that that takes out the drama out of it.)

How does setting interest rates attempt to achieve this balancing act of the dual mandate:
1. keep employment as high as possible
2. keep prices of goods/services (implying inflation) from getting too high

The interest rate is like a lever to induce/reduce demand for money: a low rate means everyone can easily borrow money to spend, a high rate means it's difficult.
- ez money => "wow let's go overhire cuz I want more growth and production" and "yay I go spend Benjamins on random shit even if my demand makes price go up"
- tight money => "oh shit I don't wanna pay that much interest expense on loans, I better cut my costs, better lay off some employees and stop buying random shit"

QED.

In 2020 when the pandemic started, everyone was locked up at home and wasn't going to spend money, and there were a ton of layoffs, so to stop the economy (and stock market) from collapsing, the Fed set interest rates to zero to encourage everyone to spend money. This serves mandate part 1, make employment go up.

Cue the money printer meme (technically I don't think the Fed was actively printing Benjamins per se but the effect was to make lending free and ez):

Then unemployment recovered and the Fed thought resulting inflation would be "transitory" and then record scratch, it was very much not transitory, so JPow goes DUELIST MODE and switches to dual mandate part 2, fight high inflation by increasing interest rates until inflation starts to cool down. (There is also a whole separate supply-side inflation rather than demand-induced, where businesses use rare supply shortages to permanently increase prices, even after the shortage goes away; see chicken wings and WingStop. More in further reading.)

I picture JPow standing in between 2 suited-up bankers, raising dual gold pistols gleaming in the sunlight, shouting "YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!... each other unless one of you pays 5+% interest!" before challenging any complainers to a rap battle duel on his podium.

Layoffs occur and inflation eventually cools down by a lot, meaning JPow started lowering interest rates because a 5% rate is way too high for businesses to be doing business (even if profits continue to grow due to high productivity in the exceptional American market). Keep it that high for much longer, and no doubt businesses would have laid off even more people who would've stayed home and processed their copium by popping pills or evil inflatable Hindenbug balloons. Or both I guess.

### How about now? March 2025

We're in a weird spot where although inflation has cooled, it's still higher than the Fed would like it to be (there's a "healthy" amount of inflation that the Fed likes to target, 2%) but they don't think it's going to go down much soon. They've paused lowering interest rates for now, and while they project something like 2 cuts by end of year, no one really knows if that'll come to fruition if inflation continues to be sticky and the so-far-strong job market doesn't get much worse.

### What does this mean for tech?

Tech is all about growth. That means hiring smart devs with high salaries, and yeeting money at GPUs and data centers. That means borrowing money to finance research + development -- profitability be damned, who cares when investors and venture capital firms will throw money at you if they see your DAU/MAU/eDAU/eMAU/[any corporate metric for users] go up and pray that your startup might eventually turn profitable. Go open your stock screener and see how many tech stocks command billions in market cap while not having any price/earnings ratio listed, because well, their earnings per share is negative because they burn money like there's no tomorrow.

High interest rates means tech companies cannot spend all the money they want on salaries and GPUs (even the best companies with strong balance sheets naturally have their limits). They have to at least be somewhat thoughtful about their costs as they can't infinitely borrow money like they could in 2020.

That ... thoughtfulness means they prioritize AI capex, since they think it's this once-a-generation opportunity to get ahead of everyone else, create "AGI" and pray they'll profit (yes even after DeepSeek made V3/R1 open source, big tech has reaffirmed they'll be spending >$300B this year -- desperation money at its finest). Existing salaries and additional hiring means more costs that they don't think they can afford when they want to focus on AI capex. Instead they'll see how much AI output they can achieve efficiently with devs that'll efficiently contribute to that mission, meaning:
- deadlines
- pressure
- burnout
- layoffs and termination
- only hire for critical positions

This is not a trend I foresee changing in the next year or 2. Gloomy as it sounds, I think knowing about these underlying macroeconomic forces and how they apply to our jobs/industry etc. at least gives us the clarity of what we can/can't expect to come.
